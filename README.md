mp++ is a C++11/14/17/20 library for multiprecision arithmetic, currently
featuring:

* arbitrary-precision integers,
* arbitrary-precision rationals,
* arbitrary-precision floats,
* quadruple-precision floats.

Design goals include:

* excellent performance for small integer and rational
  operands,
* easy embeddability in computer algebra systems and
  generic C++ libraries,
* a large collection of arbitrary-precision special functions.

Design non-goals include:

* support for fixed-size wide integrals (i.e., no ``uint512_t``,
  try [Boost Multiprecision](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/index.html>)
  instead).

Based on well-known libraries such as [GMP](https://gmplib.org/), [MPFR](https://www.mpfr.org) and others,
mp++ was initially conceived as a [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) wrapper with a special focus on performance with
small operands. In particular, a small buffer optimisation and custom implementations of basic mathematical primitives are
instrumental in achieving a performance increase, with respect to GMP and other integer multiprecision libraries, which can be
substantial (see the [benchmarks](https://bluescarni.github.io/mppp/benchmarks.html) section of the documentation).

Eventually, a multiprecision rational class and two multiprecision floating-point classes were added, and today a secondary objective
of mp++ is to provide a modern, consistent and unified C++ interface to several lower-level multiprecision libraries.

mp++ is a spinoff of the [Piranha](https://github.com/bluescarni/piranha) library, released under the
[MPL2](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/) license.
